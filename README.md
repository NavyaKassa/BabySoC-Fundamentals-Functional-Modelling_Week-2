# üñ•Ô∏è VSDBabySoC Design and Modeling - Week_2:

Welcome to the VSDBabySoC Workshop, a hands-on learning repository focused on System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals, functional modelling, simulation, and digital‚Äìanalog integration. This repository documents my learnings while building and simulating a simplified RISC-V-based SoC called BabySoC.

## üìö About This Repository:
This repository is intended for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to learn about:
- SoC fundamentals and architecture (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect)
- Functional modelling of SoCs using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave
- Digital-to-analog interfacing with a 10-bit DAC
- RISC-V core operation (RVMYTH processor)
- Hands-on simulation and verification of a small SoC

## üõ† Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog) ‚Äì Compile and simulate Verilog RTL
- GTKWave ‚Äì Waveform visualization
- SandPiper-SaaS ‚Äì Convert TL-Verilog (.tlv) to Verilog (.v)
- Git ‚Äì Version control

## üìù Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers)
- Familiarity with Linux shell commands
- Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
- Tools: git, iverilog, gtkwave, python3, pip

## üìÖ Workshop / Learning Structure:
### Part 1 ‚Äì [BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling](./Part-1)
- Introduction to SoCs: architecture, types, and design challenges
